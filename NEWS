version 10.2+0.95
2019-01-26

- Now works with audio CD's that start on a track greater than 1.
  This work was done by Edd Barrett and Thomas Schmitt
- OpenBSD tolerance

version 10.2+0.94+2
2017-08-22

- Add --force-overread
  Force overreading into the lead-out portion of the disc. This option
  is only applicable when using the "-O" option with a positive sample
  offset value. Many drives are not capable of reading into this
  portion of the disc and attempting to do so on those drives will
  produce read errors and possibly hard lockups

version 10.2+0.90

Split off from libcdio to allow more flexible licensing and to be compatible
with cdparanoia-III-10.2's license. And also, libcdio is just too large.
