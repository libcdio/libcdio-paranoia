  :-|   Normal operation, considerable jitter
  :-/   Read drift
  :-P   Unreported loss of streaming in atomic read operation
  8-|   Finding read problems at same point during reread; hard to correct

  ;-(   Gave up trying to perform a correction
  8-X   Aborted (as per -X) due to a scratch/skip
  :^D   Finished extracting

PROGRESS BAR SYMBOLS:
<space> No corrections needed
   -    Jitter correction required
   +    Unreported loss of streaming/other error in read
   !    Errors are getting through stage 1 but corrected in stage2
   e    SCSI/ATAPI transport error (corrected)
   V    Uncorrected error/skip

SPAN ARGUMENT:
The span argument may be a simple track number or a offset/span
specification.  The syntax of an offset/span takes the rough form:
  
                       1[ww:xx:yy.zz]-2[aa:bb:cc.dd] 

Here, 1 and 2 are track numbers; the numbers in brackets provide a
finer grained offset within a particular track. [aa:bb:cc.dd] is in
hours/minutes/seconds/sectors format. Zero fields need not be
specified: [::20], [:20], [20], [20.], etc, would be interpreted as
twenty seconds, [10:] would be ten minutes, [.30] would be thirty
sectors (75 sectors per second).

When only a single offset is supplied, it is interpreted as a starting
offset and ripping will continue to the end of the track.  If a single
offset is preceded or followed by a hyphen, the implicit missing
offset is taken to be the start or end of the disc, respectively. Thus:

    1:[20.35]    Specifies ripping from track 1, second 20, sector 35 to 
                 the end of track 1.

    1:[20.35]-   Specifies ripping from 1[20.35] to the end of the disc

    -2           Specifies ripping from the beginning of the disc up to
                 (and including) track 2

    -2:[30.35]   Specifies ripping from the beginning of the disc up to
                 2:[30.35]

    2-4          Specifies ripping from the beginning of track two to the
                 end of track 4.

Don't forget to protect square brackets and preceding hyphens from
the shell...

A few examples, protected from the shell:
  A) query only with exhaustive search for a drive and full reporting
     of autosense:
       @CDPARANOIA_NAME@ -vsQ

  B) extract up to and including track 3, putting each track in a separate
     file:
       @CDPARANOIA_NAME@ -B -- "-3"

  C) extract from track 1, time 0:30.12 to 1:10.00:
       @CDPARANOIA_NAME@ "[:30.12]-1[1:10]"
